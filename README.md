# GDrive for Linux
This application is a simple wrapper that allows for Google Drive file and folder synchronization in Linux.

I've started this project as I miss the ability to synchronize files in the Desktop when I switched to Linux (PopOS, then Mint) late last year. 

## Features
- File synchronization
- Ability to select what to sync
- Connect with GDrive
- and more to come!
